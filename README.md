# ❗️Optimize deprecation

Uniform Optimize has been deprecated and replaced by [Context](https://docs.uniform.app/context), a more powerful and flexible personalization solution. Optimize is not being discontinued at this time, but it will not receive updates or new features.

We do not recommend starting a new project with Optimize. If you have an existing project that uses Optimize, you can upgrade your project to Context at no cost using our [upgrade guide](https://docs.uniform.app/context/migration). If you have any issues with this process you can contact our team.
